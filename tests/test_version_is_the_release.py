"""The version this package IMPORTS as is the version it is RELEASED as.

A `__version__` constant that disagrees with the release tag is invisible to every ordinary
check: a lockfile pins a COMMIT, and nothing downstream can see that a constant inside that
commit disagrees with the tag pointing at it. A consumer following the shared-packages
adoption recipe (step 3: print the imported module's `__file__` AND its `__version__`) would
read a release number that is not the code it is running.

Why this check lives in the PACKAGE and not only in a portfolio scan: a portfolio scan can only
see a defect that has already been released and installed somewhere. This fails in the
release's own gate, before there is a tag to be wrong.

`pyproject.toml` is the authority, because it is what the build backend stamps into the
distribution metadata an installer records. `__version__` is a hand-maintained copy of that
number, which is precisely why it drifts.
